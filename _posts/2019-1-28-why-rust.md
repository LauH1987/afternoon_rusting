Most loved language three years in a row...

<!--more-->

Before I start with coding blogs, I wanted to share why I chose Rust. It began with the following article's title: *“Rust voted most loved language for the 3rd year in a row”*. Since I read it, I was a silent Rust watcher for almost a year now, wondering what makes a programming language *“loved”*. I read the Rust book and many articles, yet I have failed to write even one line of code. It is not that Rust was too complex, definitely not for a C++ developer. Yet it was apparent it is complex enough to discourage me from handling it with the little free time I had. Phrasing it in other words, I thought it would take too much time to be productive with Rust, much more time than I had to invest in it. 

Eventually, I’ve changed my mindset, the idea is not to be productive, but to learn from what Rust has to offer, its unique concepts and why is it so loved. As a side effect, I already see early signs that I was wrong, and being productive with Rust even if you have little time to spare is a reasonable goal. Appreantly I'm not the only one who thinks it:

 >"Over 40% of Rust users felt productive in Rust in less than a month of use".
