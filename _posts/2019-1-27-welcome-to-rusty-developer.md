It never really occurred to me how one start writing a new blog, I guess I’m going to find out soon...

# A New Beginning

Let’s start with you and what you should find in this blog. Two topics really come to mind: The Rust programming language, and strongly type programming, especially in the context of C++, or phrasing it otherwise, how Rust affected my C++. Knowing myself though, I’m sure it will grow to cover much more than those 2 topics.

Additionally, you should expect 2 kinds of posts, some are more personal, which will discuss personal experience, sharing my point of view. Others are going to be more professional, more of an article than a blog post.

To finish this post I’ll share a little about myself. My name is Ori Ben-Shir. I've written software professionally for over 5 years now. During the last two years, I also had the opportunity to lead a team of 4 developers. In my day job, I work in a cybersecurity company, using mostly C++. Programming Languages are my topic of interest. I love exploring their implementation, and how language authors shape the way we code with their design choices.
