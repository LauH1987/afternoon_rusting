### About the Author

My name is Ori Ben-Shir. I've written software professionally for over 5 years now. During the last two years, I also had the opportunity to lead a team of 4 developers. In my day job, I work in a cybersecurity company, using mostly C++. Programming Languages are my topic of interest. I love exploring their implementation, and how language authors shape the way we code with their design choices.
